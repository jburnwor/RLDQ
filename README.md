# RLDQ
## General Information
> RLDQ intends to be a fast-paced arcade style mish mash of minigames exhausting physical and digital health, whilst following a character throughout his day.
In RLDQ players are tasked with living a day-to-day of an average computer scientist's life. Tasks are presented in the form of mini games in which players can speed through them as fast as possible to get a higher score. Complete games faster to earn more points, but be warned faster completion will end in losing more health. Mini games include rapid mouse movement, randomized key inputs, and an assortment of puzzles that are intended to mentally fatigue the player. If the player is unable to complete tasks on time, their health will deteriorate further causing them to be unsuccessful in completing the game.

### Stamping instructions:
  Click and drag the stamp on the right to the papers in the center, then return the stamp to the it's starting position. Then, click and drag the stamped paper (white rectangle) to the bin on the left. You don't get points if you don't return the stamp before placing the paper in the bin
### Writing code
  Writing code has never been so easy! using the arrow keys or wasd to navigating the letters and type out words. Code is magically written behind you
### Washing Dishes
  There are dishes that need to be cleaned, but only menacing knives come out. Scrub back and forth to try to clean all knives before the time is up.
### Alarm instructions:
  Click and drag the blue block down onto the left button until, you reach 8am (time increments randomly).  If you get to 8am before time click the right button on the alarm clock.  300 points are added at the start and goes down with each second, the faster you are the more points you'll get.
### Bed instructions:
  You have 10 seconds to memorize the random layout of the room before the lights turn off.  Use WASD to move your character (the white square in the bottom left) 1 "space" each time.  Your goal is to get to the bed in the upper right (it is possible for you to get trapped at the current moment)
