# RLDQ
## General Information
> RLDQ intends to be a fast-paced arcade style mish mash of minigames exhausting physical and digital health, whilst following a character throughout his day.
In RLDQ players are tasked with living a day-to-day of an average computer scientist's life. Tasks are presented in the form of mini games in which players can speed through them as fast as possible to get a higher score. Complete games faster to earn more points, but be warned faster completion will end in losing more health. Mini games include rapid mouse movement, randomized key inputs, and an assortment of puzzles that are intended to mentally fatigue the player. If the player is unable to complete tasks on time, their health will deteriorate further causing them to be unsuccessful in completing the game.
